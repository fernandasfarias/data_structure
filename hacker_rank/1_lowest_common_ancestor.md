# Binary Search Tree (BST): Lowest Common Ancestor

I need to find the lowest common ancestor between two nodes.

What I thought: I need to check wether the nodes are greater or smaller than the current node. If they are greater, they should go to the right side, otherwise, they should go to the left side. If neither condition is true, then I return the current node.
